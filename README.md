# GitHub Visualization Tool
## What it does
Provides an at-a-glance overview of the repository structure. Finer details can be explored via zooming and tooltips. It makes exploring large and complex projects a breeze.

Files are displayed as a directed graph, color coded based on file types, and sized accordingly to length of file.

## Installation
Replace your own GitHub personal token key into `/js/github.js`. Serve static `index.html` on webserver of your choice.
